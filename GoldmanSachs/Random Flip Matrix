There is an m x n binary grid matrix with all the values set 0 initially. Design an algorithm to randomly pick an index (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1. All the indices (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 should be equally likely to be returned.

Optimize your algorithm to minimize the number of calls made to the built-in random function of your language and optimize the time and space complexity.

Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int m, int n) Initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix m and n.
int[] flip() Returns a random index [i, j] of the matrix where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1.
void reset() Resets all the values of the matrix to be 0.
 

Example 1:

Input
["Solution", "flip", "flip", "flip", "reset", "flip"]
[[3, 1], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [1, 0], [2, 0], [0, 0], null, [2, 0]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution(3, 1);
solution.flip();  // return [1, 0], [0,0], [1,0], and [2,0] should be equally likely to be returned.
solution.flip();  // return [2, 0], Since [1,0] was returned, [2,0] and [0,0]
solution.flip();  // return [0, 0], Based on the previously returned indices, only [0,0] can be returned.
solution.reset(); // All the values are reset to 0 and can be returned.
solution.flip();  // return [2, 0], [0,0], [1,0], and [2,0] should be equally likely to be returned.

class Solution {
public:
    int n, m;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    Solution(int m, int n) {
        this->n = n;
        this->m = m;
    }
    
    vector<int> flip() {
        int I = i, J = j;
        if(j+1 < n) j++;
        else if(i+1 < m){
            i++;
            j = 0;
        }else{
            i = 0; j = 0;
        }
        
        return {I, J};
        
    }
    
    void reset() {
       
    }
};
